Administrator makes no warranties, express or implied, as to the suitability, accuracy or reliability of any Content and other materials on the Website. Nonetheless, Administrator reserves the right to prevent you from submitting User Generated Content and to edit, restrict or remove any User Generated Content for any reason at any time. You agree that Administrator shall accept no liability if we prevent, in our sole discretion, your User Generated Content from being submitted, or we edit, restrict or remove it. You also agree to permit any other user of this Site and any third-party website on which your User Generated Content may be included, to access, view, store and reproduce the material for such user’s personal use.</p>
